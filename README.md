# bic - Fork of sic

bic is a fork of the sic IRC client, with features like colors and formatting. It supports all the default IRC text formats: bold, underline,
italic, strikethrough, and colors. These can be entered in plain text using characters modifiable in `config.h`. You can escape stuff with `\`.

Also the code is a mess, don't look at it.
